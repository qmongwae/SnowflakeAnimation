Snowflake Animation
This is a simple JavaScript code that generates a snowflake animation effect on a webpage. Snowflakes gently fall down the screen, creating a serene winter atmosphere.

Usage
To use this code, simply include the index.js file in your HTML document. The snowflake animation will start automatically when the HTML document is loaded.

How it Works
Creating Snowflakes: The createSnowflake() function generates a snowflake element and appends it to the document body. Each snowflake is given a random position on the screen, animation duration, and opacity.

Animating Snowflakes: The createSnowflakes() function controls the number of snowflakes generated by calling createSnowflake() at regular intervals.

Animation End: Each snowflake element is removed from the document body when its animation ends. This prevents excessive memory usage.

Customization
You can customize the appearance of the snowflakes by modifying the CSS styles in your HTML or adding additional styles to the styles.css file.
Adjust the animation interval in the createSnowflakes() function to control the rate at which snowflakes are generated.
Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Snowflakes</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> <!-- (Optional) Add additional styles -->
</head>
<body>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

Enjoy the Snowflakes!
